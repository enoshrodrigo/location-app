# Location-Based Shopping App

Welcome to our third-year project for the Human-Computer Interaction course! We have developed a location-based shopping app that primarily focuses on the front end, providing an intuitive and interactive shopping experience for users. This app also includes a backend component using Node.js and MySQL for database management.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

- **Location-Based Shopping:** Our app leverages the user's location to provide a personalized shopping experience. It displays items available at stores near the user's current location.

- **Shopping Cart with Discounts:** Users can add items to their shopping cart, and the app calculates discounts based on the location and displays the adjusted checkout price.

- **React Native and TypeScript:** We've built the app using React Native and TypeScript to ensure a smooth and type-safe development process.
